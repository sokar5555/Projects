The Final Project is to be a complete simulation study of a real system of your
choosing. The model must use Discrete-Event Simulation and Arena. The project will
be graded based on the following characteristics.
• Defining the system to be simulated and stating the purpose of the study.
• Collecting data on the system and using it to determine input probability
distributions and other parameters.
• Coding and verifying the model.
• Visualization of your model
• Exercising the model to evaluate the system as it is, and at least one alternate
configuration or operating policy, with an eye toward improvement. Pay attention
to concerns about the statistical validity of your results, i.e., do an appropriate
statistical analysis of the simulation output, including the comparison or selection
or optimum-seeking.
• Prepare a video presentation of your model. The presentation should include:
1. A description of your model and why it was selected
2. An overview of the data collection and analysis
3. A review of your model design/flow. Possibly show model animation
4. Trial at least 1 change using your model and discuss the knowledge
gleaned from the simulation that could be applied to the given business
situation.
5. Recommendations and next steps that could be generated from the model.
• Presentations should be between 8 and 10 minutes in length and may include a
demonstration of your model.
